        "Okay, we've seen how to deal with a regression problem in TensorFlow, let's look at how we can approach a classification problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "A [classification problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification) involves predicting whether something is one thing or another.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, you might want to:\n",
        "* Predict whether or not someone has heart disease based on their health parameters. This is called **binary classification** since there are only two options.\n",
        "* Decide whether a photo of is of food, a person or a dog. This is called **multi-class classification** since there are more than two options.\n",
        "* Predict what categories should be assigned to a Wikipedia article. This is called **multi-label classification** since a single article could have more than one category assigned.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we're going to work through a number of different classification problems with TensorFlow. In other words, taking a set of inputs and predicting what class those set of inputs belong to.\n",
        "\n",
        "## What we're going to cover\n",
        "\n",
        "Specifically, we're going to go through doing the following with TensorFlow:\n",
        "- Architecture of a classification model\n",
        "- Input shapes and output shapes\n",
        "  - `X`: features/data (inputs)\n",
        "  - `y`: labels (outputs)\n",
        "    - \"What class do the inputs belong to?\"\n",
        "- Creating custom data to view and fit\n",
        "- Steps in modelling for binary and mutliclass classification\n",
        "  - Creating a model\n",
        "  - Compiling a model\n",
        "    - Defining a loss function\n",
        "    - Setting up an optimizer\n",
        "      - Finding the best learning rate\n",
        "    - Creating evaluation metrics\n",
        "  - Fitting a model (getting it to find patterns in our data)\n",
        "  - Improving a model\n",
        "- The power of non-linearity\n",
        "- Evaluating classification models\n",
        "  - Visualizng the model (\"visualize, visualize, visualize\")\n",
        "  - Looking at training curves\n",
        "  - Compare predictions to ground truth (using our evaluation metrics)\n"
